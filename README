This is a fork of https://bitbucket.org/shor-ty/vimextensionopenfoam/overview by Tobias Holzmann
with the aim of reaching Pathogene/Vundle compatibility aswell as Colorscheme neutrality.
Right now Pathogene/Vundle compatibility works but the changes break autocomplete-compatibility
for non-vundle/pathogene installs.
The colorscheme is still available but by default vim will use YOUR colorscheme and not the supplied one.

Installation with vundle (https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) is as easy as adding it to your .vimrc
with
"Plugin effi/vim-OpenFoam-syntax"
or
"Plugin git://bitbucket.org/effi-x/vim-openfoam-syntax.git"
It is highly recommended to use the great solarized theme/colorscheme by ethan schoonover at
http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
